# PIMA-Dataset-Classification-using-PCA
The goal of the project is to use principal component analysis to perform a classification task for which the training data is fewer than what is needed for a deep learning model. I worked on the Pima Indians Diabetes Data Set (https://www.kaggle.com/dssariya/pima-indians-diabetes-data-set) I successfully implemented the model and a comparison with a solution without PCA gave useful insights in understanding the results.
